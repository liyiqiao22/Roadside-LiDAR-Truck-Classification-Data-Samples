# Roadside-LiDAR-Truck-Classification-Data-Samples
The repository demonstrate the sample raw Lidar point cloud data used for roadside truck classification data collection.

The roadside lidar data has been used to investigate the development of truck body type and FHWA axle-based classification. 
For the model development, please refer to these two publications:
1. Truck body type classification using a deep representation learning ensemble on 3D point sets: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X21004496
2. LiDAR Vehicle Point Cloud Reconstruction Framework for Axle-based Classification: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10016293
